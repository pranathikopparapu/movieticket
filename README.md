 🎟️ Serverless Ticket Booking Web Application  

 A serverless ticket booking platform built with React and AWS cloud services (serverless backend).  
This application enables users to browse movies/events, view details, select seats, book tickets, and receive booking confirmations — all on a scalable, cost-efficient, and secure serverless architecture**.  

🎯 Project Objective  
To design and implement a **cloud-native, serverless ticket booking system** that reduces infrastructure costs, improves scalability, and provides a seamless user experience.  



 🔹 Problem Statement  

Traditional ticket booking systems rely on servers that require continuous monitoring, maintenance, and scaling during high traffic.  
This results in higher costs, complexity, and downtime.  
The **serverless model** eliminates these challenges by using **AWS pay-per-use services**, ensuring automatic scaling and reduced operational overhead.

- 🔑 User Authentication (AWS Cognito)  
- 🎥 Movie & Event Listings with images and details  
- 🪑 Interactive Seat Selection (availability tracking)  
- 🛒 Booking Cart & Checkout process  
- 💳 Multiple Payment Modes (UPI, NetBanking, COD simulation)
